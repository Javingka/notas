CHAPTER I

p1
  VIS for short: 
    "Computer-based visualization systems provide viusal representation of datasets designed to help carry out task more effectively."
    "Visualizatoin is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods. The design space of possible vis idioms is huge, and includes the consideration of both how to create how to interact with visual representations.
    Vis design is full of trade-offs, and most possibilities in the design space are inefective for a particular task, so validating the effectiveness of a design is both necesary and dificult. 
    Vis designers must take into account three different kinds of resource limitations: Those of computers, of humans, and of displays.
    Vis usage can be analysed in terms of why the user needs it, what data is shown, and how the idiom is designed."

p2
  Vis allows people to analyze data when they don't know exactly what questions they need to ask in advance.

  Comentario:
  Vis can be useful in special and specifics parts of any data process. Can be meaningless to use with a final user of a trade-market software. But can be usefull for developers to improve the debugger tasks.

p4
  1.3 Why Have a Comp....
  By enlisting computation, you can build tools that allow people to explore or present datasets that would be completely infeasible to draw by hand, thus opening the possibility of seeing how datasets change over time.

p6
  1.4 Why Use External...
  External representations augment human capability by allowing us to surpass the limitations of our own internal cognition and memory.

  Diagram as external memory: Organized by spation location.
    Search: Can be speed up         by   grouping all the items needed for a specific problem-solving inference together at the same location.
    Recognition: can be facilitated by   grouping all the relevant information about one item in the same location, avoiding the need fot matching remembered symbolic labels.

p8
  Anscombe's quartet
  Comprises 4 datasets that have nearly identical simple statistical properties.
    Mean of x in each case              9(exact) | In probability and statistics, 'mean' and 'expected value' are used synonymously to refer to one measure of the ' central tendency', either of a probability distribution or the random variable characterized by that distribution.
    Sample variance of x in each case   11(exact) | In probability theory and statistics, variance measures how far a set of numbers is spread out
    Mean of y in each case              7.5 (to 2 decimal places )
    Sample variance of y in each case   4.122 or 4.127 (to 3 decimal places)
    Correlation between x and y in each case	0.816 (to 3 decimal places)
    Linear regression line in each case	y = 3.00 + 0.500x (to 2 and 3 decimal places, respectively) | linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. 

    Dependent and independent variables
      Variables used in an experiment or modelling can be divided into three types: "dependent variable", "independent variable", or other. 
        The "dependent variable" represents the output or effect, or is tested to see if it is the effect. 
        The "independent variables" represent the inputs or causes, or are tested to see if they are the cause. Other variables may also be observed for various reasons.
 
p11
    1.9 Why Focus con Task
    A Vis tool can support differents task, depending on the users and the dataset the users have.
    1.10 
    The focus on effectiveness is a corollary of defining vis to have the goal of supporting user tasks.
  
p13
    A fundamental principle of design is to consider multiple alternatives and then choose the best.

p14
    1.12
    The problem of 'validation' for a vis design is difficult because there are so many questions that you could ask when considering whether a vis tool has met yours design goals.
    1.13
    Three different kinds of limitations:
      Computational capacity.
      Human perpectual and cognitive capacity.
      Display capacity.

p17
    Figure 1.7 Shows the high-level framework for analyzing vis
      - WHAT the user sees.
      - WHY the user intends to use a vis tool
      - HOW the visual encoding and interaction idioms are constructed in terms of design choices.

    Each three fold WHAT-WHY-HOW question has a corresponding DATA-TASK-IDIOM answer trio.

CHAPTER II | WHAT: Data Abstraction (See What? schema at the begining the the chapter)

p22
    You need to know two crosscutting pieces of information about each term inside a dataset.
      Their semantics: Is the real-world meaning.
      Their type: Is its structural or mathematical interpretation.
        At the data level, what kind of thing is it: An item, a link, an attribute?
        At the dataset level, how are these data types combined into a larger structure: a table, a tree, a field of sampled values?
        At the attribute level, what kind of mathematical operations are meaninful for it?. For exemple is a number represents a count of boxes, its type is quantity, so makes sense to add items. If a number represents a postal code, its type is 'code' rather than 'quantity', adding two of these numbers does not make sense.
 
p23
    2.3 Five basic datatypes
      Items: Individual entity that is discrete. Row in a simple table or a node in a network. (People, stocks, coffee shops, genes, or cities).
      Attributes: Some specific property that can be measured, observed, or logged. (Salary, price, number of sales, protein expression level, temperature).
      Links: is a relationship between items. typically within a network.
      Positions: spatial data, provading a location in 2d or 3d. (latitude-longitude or three numbers specifying a location within the region os space measured by a medical scanner).
      Grid: Specifies the strategy for sampling continuous data in terms of both geometric and topological relationships between its cells.

p24
    2.4 Dataset Types
      Datset: Collection of information that is the target od analysis 
      4 basic dataset types.
        Tables        Items - Attributes
        Networks      Items(nodes)  - Attributes  - Links 
        Fields        Attributes  - Grids (Positions)
        Geometry      Items - Positions
 
      Spatial Fields: For exemple the visualization of materials's resistance. temperature and air pressure over a airplane wings
      Grid types: Uniform grid. (don't store grid geometry or grid topology).
                  Rectilinear grid. Nonuniform sampling
                  Structured grid. Curvilinear shapes, where the geometric location of each cell needs to be specified.
                  Unstructured grid. complete flexibility, topological information and spatial positions, must be stored explicity.
      Geometry: specifies info about the shape of items with explicit spatial positions. The items could be points, one-dimensional lines, curves, 2d surfaces or regions, or 3D volumens.
                Don't necessary have attributes

p31
    2.5 Attributes types
      Categorical vs ordered
      Categorical: The type os this data does not have an implicit ordering. but it often  has hierarchical structure.
                   Can only distinguish whether two things are the same or different. 
                   Other categorical ex: movie genres, file types, city names.
      
      Ordered: all does have an implicit ordering, as opposed to un-ordered categorical data.
        Oridinal Ordered: such a shirt size, as there is a well-defined ordering. Ranking is other ex: top-ten list of movies, initial lineups for sports tournaments depending on past performance.
        Quantitative Ordered: A measurement of magnitude that supports arithmetic comparision. Ex (Weight, temperature, stock price, number of calling functions ina program, number of drinks sold at a coffee shop. Integers and Real-Numbers are quantitative data.

p34
    2.6 Semantics
    The classification in this book is heavily focused on the semantics:
    Keys vs values,     and the related questions of 
    Spatial and continuos data vs nonspatial and discrete data    to match up  with the idiom design choice analsis framwork.
    
      Key => as index
      value => attribute 

      2.6.1.1 A 'flat table' has only one key, each item corresponds to a row with any numbers of attributes. 
        Key might be complety implicit, as the index of the row.
        Key might be explicit, where it is contained within the table as attribute.
        Key might be categorical or ordinal attributes.

p36
      2.6.1.2 A 'Multidimensional Table'
      Multiples keys are required to look up an item.

p37
      2.6.1.3 'Fields'
        Although fields differ from tables a fundamental way because they represent continuous rather than discrete data. On 'spatial field' independent variable is used instead key, and dependent variable instead of value.
        Structured by sampling ina systematic way so that each grid cell is spanned by a unique range from a continuous domain. Ex the visualization of material resistance.
        Characterized in terms of number of key vs values.
          Multivariate structure depends on the number of value attributes.
          Multidimensional structure depends on the number of keys.
        Scalar field: one attribute per cell.
          Unvariate. A single value attribute.
          An Ex. The Cloud Points in a depth image from Kinect.
        Vector field: two or more attributes per cell
          Multivariate. 
          Each point in a vector field has a position, direction and magnitude. 
          Ex. Velocity of air in the room at a specific time-point.
        Tensor field: many attributes per cell.
          Array of attributes on each point.
          Ex. test of material stress. defined by nine numbers that represent forces acting in three orthogonal directions.

CHAPTER III | Why: Task Abstraction

  Actions & Targets
    Verbs describing actions and nouns describing targets.
  3.4 Actions
    Three levels of 'actions' define USER GOALS.
    Analyze Level (highest). how is been used to analyze
      Consume or Produce info.
    Search Level (middle). What kind of search
      'target' & 'location' of target (items?,elements?) are known or not
    Query Level (low). what do the user need?
      Queries:
        Identify one target
        Compare some targets
        Summarize all targets 

/*  Here the book has a little inconsistency of hierarchy in the titles. 'Analyze' has 3.4.1 and 'Produce' that is first child has 3.4.2 and the subject 'consume' (at the same level as Produce) don't have a title, it is implicit on 3.4.1 */

p45
    3.4.1 Analyze and 
      Goals: Consume existing information or produce new information. 
      Consume. Goal is to: 
        - Present: To present something that the user already understands to a third party.
        - Discover: For the user to discover something new or analyze information that is not already completely understood.
        - Enjoy: Users to enjoy a vis to indulge their casual Interest in a topic. 
p47
      3.4.1.1 Discover 
        FIND NEW KNOWDLEDGE THAT WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOWN.
        Can generate new hypothesis.
        Or 'verify' -or disconfirm- an existing hypothesis
      3.4.1.2 Present
        Use for the succint communication of information.   
        Telling a story with data.
        Guiding an audience through a series of cognitive operations.
        This goal is being used by somebody to communicate something specific and already understood to an audience.
p48   3.4.1.3 Enjoy 
      	Casual encounters with vis
	This book assumes two goals aligned, discovery with a particular audience and use for pure enjoyment for different group of people

    3.4.2 Produce
      Generate new material. Often the gloal is to produce output as input to a next instance. 
      Three kinds of produce goals:
p49        
        3.4.2.1 Annotate
          Addition of graphical or textual annotations associated with one or more preexisting viz elements.
          Typically as a manual action by the user.          
          Can be thought as a new attribute for them.

        3.4.2.2 Record
          Saves or captures viz elements as persistent artifact. as screen shots, list of book-market elements or locations, parameter settings, interaction logs or annotations. 
          The record choice saves a persistent artifact, in contrast to the annotate, which attaches information temporarily to existing elements.
